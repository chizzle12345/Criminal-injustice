<section id="intro">
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>The American criminal justice system is one of the most powerful institutions shaping social outcomes in the United States. However, for generations, it has also functioned as a vehicle for systemic racism—particularly against Black Americans. Racial disparities in arrests, sentencing, incarceration, and post-prison life have led to long-term socioeconomic harm for Black individuals and communities.</p>
  <p>This project explores how structural elements of the criminal justice system—both past and present—have contributed to a cycle of racial inequality. Drawing from academic research and rhetorical analysis, it presents a persuasive argument that systemic racism is deeply embedded within law enforcement and legal practices, and that it requires intentional reform.</p>
  <p><strong>Thesis:</strong> Through rhetorical analysis, this website will show how systemic racism in the criminal justice system uses policy, data, and power to maintain racial inequality, and why dismantling these systems is necessary for a just society.</p>

<section id="analysis">
  <h2>Rhetorical Analysis</h2>
  <p>To analyze systemic racism, it is essential to examine the rhetoric that surrounds the justice system. Three classical rhetorical appeals—ethos, logos, and pathos—are commonly used in both supporting and challenging the system's actions.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Ethos:</strong> By referencing trusted academic sources and studies, this composition builds credibility and authority. For example, Bruce & Pettit (2020) provide a comprehensive historical analysis that traces how laws and sentencing guidelines were designed with racially discriminatory intent.</li>
    <li><strong>Pathos:</strong> Emotional appeals are powerful tools in calling attention to injustice. Images of protests, personal stories of wrongful imprisonment, and statistics on racial profiling provoke empathy and outrage, pushing audiences to reflect and act.</li>
    <li><strong>Logos:</strong> Data-driven arguments, such as incarceration rates by race, and research from Devah Pager (2003) about hiring discrimination, form the logical basis of the argument. These facts are difficult to ignore and lend weight to the claim that racism is embedded, not incidental.</li>
  </ul>

<section id="evidence">
  <h2>Research & Evidence</h2>
  <p>To support this rhetorical analysis, this project integrates findings from multiple peer-reviewed academic sources.</p>
  <p><strong>Bruce & Pettit (2020)</strong> explain that systemic racism has roots going back to slavery and Jim Crow laws. Their research shows how the War on Drugs and mandatory minimum sentencing disproportionately targeted Black Americans, leading to decades of over-policing and over-incarceration. This historical context is essential for understanding why racial inequality persists today.</p>
  <p><strong>Turner & Jones (2019)</strong> provide empirical data on racial profiling. Their study found that Black drivers are significantly more likely to be stopped, searched, and arrested than White drivers—even though White drivers are statistically more likely to be found with contraband. This profiling leads to lifelong consequences, including court fees, criminal records, and incarceration.</p>
  <p><strong>Devah Pager (2003)</strong> conducted a landmark study that sent out fake job applications. She found that White men with criminal records were more likely to be called back for interviews than Black men with no criminal records. This research demonstrates how the effects of systemic racism extend beyond prison and into economic life.</p>
  <p>Together, these studies create a powerful, multidimensional argument that the justice system enforces—not just reflects—racial inequality.</p>

<section id="context">
  <h2>Broader Social Context</h2>
  <p>The consequences of systemic racism in the criminal justice system do not end at the prison gates. Once a person is labeled a criminal, their access to housing, employment, education, and voting rights is restricted. These barriers disproportionately affect Black communities, contributing to cycles of poverty and marginalization.</p>
  <p>For example, formerly incarcerated individuals often face "collateral consequences" such as being ineligible for public housing or student loans. Black families are more likely to have members entangled in the justice system, which results in family instability and economic loss. As Pager (2003) noted, discrimination in the job market means that punishment doesn't stop when a sentence ends.</p>
  <p>Organizations like <a href="https://www.sentencingproject.org" target="_blank">The Sentencing Project</a> work to expose these disparities and push for reforms. Their reports emphasize the need to rethink policing, abolish cash bail, and reinvest in communities rather than prisons.</p>

<section id="conclusion">
  <h2>Conclusion & Call to Action</h2>
  <p>This project demonstrates that systemic racism in the criminal justice system is not accidental, but a structural issue reinforced through policy, culture, and rhetoric. Through historical evidence, statistical analysis, and emotional appeal, it becomes clear that reforms must be made to break the cycle of inequality.</p>
  <p><strong>What can be done?</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Advocate for legislation that limits mandatory minimums and bans racial profiling.</li>
    <li>Support organizations that provide reentry services for formerly incarcerated people.</li>
    <li>Share educational resources and vote for reform-minded candidates.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We all have a role to play. By acknowledging the rhetoric and realities of systemic injustice, we can begin to dismantle it—one policy, one story, and one voice at a time.</p>
  <p>Additionally, we must continue to challenge the narratives that support discriminatory practices. This includes critically analyzing media portrayals of crime, holding public officials accountable for biased rhetoric, and supporting educational initiatives that teach inclusive history. Change doesn’t happen overnight, but consistent advocacy and awareness can reshape the justice system for future generations.</p>
