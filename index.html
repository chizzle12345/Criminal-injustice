  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Systemic racism in the criminal justice system continues to create long-term disadvantages for Black Americans in the United States. From policing to incarceration, policies have reinforced racial inequality across generations. This project investigates how structural injustice in the system disproportionately impacts Black communities and why it matters today.</p>
  <p>Black individuals are overrepresented at every level of the justice process: from traffic stops to pretrial detention, sentencing, and post-release barriers. These patterns are not isolated incidents but are deeply tied to historical and institutional frameworks.</p>
  <p><strong>Thesis:</strong> Through the use of rhetorical strategies like logos, ethos, and pathos, we can analyze how systemic racism is perpetuated in the criminal justice system and how it reproduces economic, political, and social inequalities for Black Americans.</p>

<section id="analysis">
  <h2>Rhetorical Analysis</h2>
  <p>This website employs rhetorical appeals to highlight and explain systemic racism. The goal is to both inform and persuade the audience to recognize that racism within the justice system is structural, not incidental.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Ethos (credibility):</strong> Using peer-reviewed studies and expert analyses builds trust in the argument. For example, Bruce & Pettit (2020) offer detailed historical insight on how policy has enforced inequality, from Jim Crow laws to mandatory minimum sentences in the War on Drugs era.</li>
    <li><strong>Pathos (emotion):</strong> The inclusion of protest imagery, references to racial profiling, and stories of post-incarceration discrimination evokes empathy and indignation. This emotional engagement makes the argument more compelling and human-centered.</li>
    <li><strong>Logos (logic):</strong> Presenting clear data—such as the fact that Black men are incarcerated at nearly six times the rate of White men—reinforces the logical case for reform. Devah Pager’s (2003) study shows how criminal records exacerbate employment discrimination, logically connecting incarceration to economic disparity.</li>
  </ul>

<section id="evidence">
  <h2>Research & Evidence</h2>
  <p>Three key sources provide the foundation for this project’s argument:</p>

  <p><strong>1. Bruce & Pettit (2020)</strong> provide a historical overview showing that modern justice policies did not emerge in a vacuum. They are the continuation of policies historically designed to control and marginalize Black populations. Their article details how laws such as stop-and-frisk and mandatory minimums reflect deep-rooted racial ideologies.</p>

  <p><strong>2. Turner & Jones (2019)</strong> focus on the effects of racial profiling. Their data reveals that Black drivers are more likely to be pulled over, searched, and arrested despite lower rates of contraband possession. The authors argue that these practices are not merely biased—they are built into law enforcement culture and training, reinforcing fear and mistrust in Black communities.</p>

  <p><strong>3. Pager (2003)</strong> conducted a groundbreaking field experiment. She sent fake job applications with equivalent qualifications, differing only by race and criminal record. The result: White applicants with criminal records received more callbacks than Black applicants with clean records. This shows how incarceration amplifies racial inequality even after release.</p>

  <p>These sources collectively show that systemic racism is both a legal and social issue. It’s not just about unequal treatment—it’s about unequal opportunity, reinforced by laws, institutions, and long-standing cultural narratives.</p>

<section id="context">
  <h2>Larger Context</h2>
  <p>Systemic racism in the criminal justice system does not exist in isolation. It contributes to broader inequalities in housing, education, health, and employment. For example, a criminal record often disqualifies individuals from public housing, limits access to student loans, and restricts voting rights. These barriers disproportionately affect Black Americans, who are more likely to be arrested and sentenced harshly.</p>

  <p>Children of incarcerated parents are more likely to face poverty, trauma, and educational challenges. Entire neighborhoods suffer when large numbers of residents are removed through mass incarceration, leading to destabilized communities. This ripple effect is one reason why reforming the justice system is key to addressing structural racism as a whole.</p>

  <p>Organizations like <a href="https://www.sentencingproject.org" target="_blank">The Sentencing Project</a> work to highlight these broader impacts and advocate for change. They promote alternatives to incarceration, voting rights restoration, and reinvestment in education and mental health services.</p>

<section id="conclusion">
  <h2>Conclusion & Call to Action</h2>
  <p>Systemic racism within the criminal justice system is not merely a historical artifact—it is a present-day reality. Through rhetorical analysis and academic research, this project shows that the justice system continues to disproportionately target and disadvantage Black Americans. The problem is not a few “bad actors”—it’s a system that was built and sustained on unequal foundations.</p>

  <p><strong>Call to Action:</strong> Each of us has a role to play in confronting injustice. Educate yourself and others. Support bail reform and efforts to end racial profiling. Vote for policymakers who prioritize justice reform. Donate to organizations that provide legal aid, reentry services, or advocate for systemic change.</p>

  <p>The path forward will not be easy, but it begins with awareness, analysis, and action. By amplifying the voices of those most affected and demanding accountability from institutions, we can build a justice system rooted in equity and fairness.</p>
